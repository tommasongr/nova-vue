# Vue for Nova editor

This is a plugin providing Vue language support for the new [Nova editor by Panic](https://panic.com/nova/). Inspired by [Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur) and many other great Vue tools.

> WARNING: If you want to use PUG in your template you first have to install an extension that provides you PUG syntax, otherwise Nova will crash. Panic has been notified of this issue.

## Features

### Vue Language Server üî•

This extension provides a fully featured support for [VLS](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/tree/master/server) (Vue Language Server). VLS is a Language Server compatible with the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and it is developed within the Vetur project.

The Vue Language Server offers advanced code features like code completion, intellisense and so on.

#### NEW: Configurable Settings ‚öôÔ∏è

From **v4.0** almost all the settings available for the Vue Language Server are configurable both globally and per project.

### NEW: Vue Information Sidebar ü§î

From **v4.0** the extension ships with a new Information Sidebar! You can see the current status of the server and the version of the server currently in execution. Right now is pretty minimal but I hope to expand on it in the future releases.

### NEW: Status Notifications üö¶

From **v4.0** the extension ships with an improved notification system, giving you more information about what is going on. If you don't like them you can of course disable this feature from the settings.

### Special Theming üé®

Vue for Nova offers an easy way to improve the syntax highlighting in a Vue file. Have a look!
