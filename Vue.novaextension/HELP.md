# Troubleshooting üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

If you encounter some issue with the Vue Language Server you may want to try reload it. You can do that from the extension menu or from the Vue Information Sidebar.

If reloading doesn't solve your problem you may want to try restoring the defaults settings. You can do that from the extension menu or the command palette.

If none of the above solves your problems you can uninstall/reinstall the extension. That should solve any issue.
